Resonance TODO list:

* Make tests for harmonics

* Implement keyboard input with isomorphic Wicki layout

* Implement tuning systems

* Make some plots or images with matplotlib
Refresh rate = 1/30s. 44100 Hz / 30 = 1470 samples per buffer

* Experiment with harmonics

* Experiment with noises

===

Resonance DONE list:

* Make extensive tests for Osc slicing and 
maybe use slicing for ordering also -- [::3] = order(3)!

* Make playing sound work

* Harmonics have symbolic ratios for overtones.
OR a generating function!
(remember to make some limit, because 20 Hz * 1024 = 20480 Hz)

overtones = [2,3,4,5,6,7]
overtones = 1.5 * n
