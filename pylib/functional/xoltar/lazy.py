    Lazy expressions are expressions which are not computed until needed.
    Many functional languages (Haskell, Scheme, OCaml, etc.) provide support
    for this as a language feature, but a large class of those things can
    be simulated in Python with this class and/or LazyTuple.
    Things that will force a lazy expression *expr* to be evaluated:
        - *expr*.eval()
        - any value comparison, such as *expr* < 5, or *expr* == "abc"
        - any sort of operation such as slicing, getattrs, or mathematical
          opertions, **unless the other operands involved are also lazy.**
        - calling str(*expr*). Same for int, float, long.
    A lazy expression is evaluated in the namespaces of the code which constructed
    it, unless the defaults are overridden. For example:

    a = 5
    laz = LazyExpr("a * 5")
    a = 7
    assert laz == 25

    #Now laz can be used in any context, and will always evaluate to 25, even if

class LazyTuple(LazySequence):
    """
    Lazy tuples (equivalent to lazy lists in functional languages) are sequences
    whose values are calculated on demand. In a normal (strict) tuple, every
    value in the tuple must be known at the time it is constructed, and it has a
    definite length. Not so with LazyTuples, which may have potentially infinite
    length, and the value at a given index is computed only when needed for some
    other calculation.

    In this implementation, a function is defined which takes two arguments, an
    index, and the LazyTuple the index is being done on. Whatever this function
    returns is the value of the LazyTuple at that index. The function will only
    be called once for each index, and the cached value will be used in
    subsequent indexing operations.

    For example:

    #Build a lazy list of squares:
    def square(index, seq):
        return index * index

    >>>laz = LazyList(itemFunc = square)
    >>>print laz[2]
    4
    >>>

    #But this is a simple case which can be extrapolated directly from the
    #index. A better example:

    def factorial(index, seq):
        if index == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return seq[index -1] * index

    >>>laz = LazyList(itemFunc = factorial)
    >>>laz[3]
    6
    >>>

    In this last example, laz[3] caused factorial to be called with index == 3,
    which in turn forced the evaluation (because it's necessary for factorial
    construction) of all the indices prior to 3. In the first example, no
    other indices need to be computed.

    Note that neither of these examples *terminates*, that is they are both
    of infinite length (actually they'll overflow from integer multiplication
    eventually, but's that's not important for this discussion). When dealing
    with infinite tuples, a few rules apply:

    - *lazytuple*.isTerminating() will return 1 if the tuple has definite length,
        0 otherwise.
    - len(*lazytuple*) will raise a RuntimeError if the list is infinite.
    - if *lazytuple*: will always be true for an infinite tuple.
    - LazyTuples may be compared normally.
    - iteration over a LazyTuple with for works fine, but if the tuple doesn't
      terminate, neither will your loop!
